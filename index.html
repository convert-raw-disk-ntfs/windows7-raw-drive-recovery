You can free download iCare Data Recovery and install it on your computer. Then you are able to run the software to scan the RAW disk partition so that the software can help you find the lost files.

<ol>
<li>When a hard disk has RAW file system, Windows operating system may ask you to <a href="http://www.icare-recovery.com/howto/recover-formatted-drive.html">format the disk</a>. It is highly recommended you not to format the disk before files have been restored.</li>
<li>If you <a href="http://www.icare-recovery.com/faq/accidentally-formatted-drive.html">accidentally format the hard disk</a> when it shows RAW file system without recovering its data, you had better stop writing new files to the formatted partition but you should run iCare Data Recovery to perform data recovery as soon as possible.</li>
<li>When you want to save the recovered files, you cannot save them to the original disk partition which has RAW drive error. You had better store them to an external storage device.</li>
<li>When files have been restored, you had better backup the important files to avoid data loss again.</li>
